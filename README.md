## Material Passport Ontology (MPO) ##
MPO is a generic ontology that represents the common properties of the material passport of a product or component across applications in the automotive and wind turbine blade industries. The ontology is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWorldAvatar/ontology/refs/heads/main/MPO.owl).

### Documentation
The HTML documentation (LODE) is available [here](https://theworldavatar.github.io/mpo).

## Application ##
MPO can be used to represent material passports of products or components and enable data interoperability across industrial stakeholders, including manufacturers, suppliers, collectors, and recyclers, to calculate the material circularity indicator of a product or component that requires data from multiple parties.
